Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)


Introduction

In this assignment you will use Pytorch libraries and functions to perform a classification task on objects in CIFAR10 dataset. You will use a prebuilt version of the dataset from pytorch. You will have to perform some image preprocessing techniques before preparing a model. Then you will develop a Convolutional Neural Network model using PyTorch abstraction. Along the training process, you will compare the model at different stage of training. Finally you will select the best model based on your evaluation plots and test the model on unseen test data.
